# nix-config

> nix-darwin, home-manager and dotfiles managed by nix.

## Features

- nix with [nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
- nix-darwin
- home-manager (via nix-darwin but could work as standalone too)
- homebrew casks (via nix-darwin)
- several dev-shells [WIP]

## Machines

| Host     | Hardware     | named after                                                |
|----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Kare`   | Apple Laptop | [Susan Kare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare)     |
| `Hopper` | Apple Laptop | [Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) |

My standard username is `pw`. All code will be placed in the `~/Documents/Code/weiland/` directory.
Previously, all my code was stored in `~/src/weiland`.

## Installation

> on a freshly clean mac machine

### Setup machine

#### iCloud

During Setup:

1. Login in to iCloud 
2. System Settings -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive: enable *Desktop & Documents Folders*.
3. Disable *Optimize Mac Storage* for Documents (and later in Photos, too), so all data will be downloaded.

#### System Updates

Making sure system is up-to-date:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate --install --all --restart --verbose
```

#### Xcode and Developer Tools

Install command line developer tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Then, install [**Xcode**](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&uo=4) from the App Store.

Now, _accept_ the _Xcode and SDK license_:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

And make sure Xcode runs:

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch
```

Open **Xcode** go to _Preferences_, open the _Platforms_ tab and download iOS and VisioOS Simulators.

#### Install Rosetta

Actually, I try to avoid it, but looking at you _AusweisApp.app_

```fish
softwareupdate â€“install-rosetta
```


#### Code directories

Create code directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Code/weiland
mkdir ~/Documents/Code/clones
mkdir ~/Documents/Code/tests
mkdir ~/Documents/Code/go
```

#### Clone this *nix-config*

On a new system, the file modes might be lost, and have to be fixed so the keys can be accessed:

```fish
chmod 600 ~/Documents/Configs/ssh/id_pw
```

Now we can clone. In order to prevent password prompts and because there is no `~/.ssh` directory yet with key pairs, we start with a different key path:

```fish
GIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i ~/Documents/Configs/ssh/id_pw -o IdentitiesOnly=yes' git clone git@github.com:weiland/nix-config.git ~/Documents/Code/weiland/nix-config
```

<details>
<summary>other ways to clone (if ssh keys or GitHub are already setup):</summary>

```fish
# using ssh (with default key in ~/.ssh)
git clone git@github.com:weiland/nix-config.git ~/Documents/Code/weiland/nix-config

# or using default (i.e. login to GitHub)
git clone https://github.com/weiland/nix-config.git ~/Documents/Code/weiland/nix-config
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>If there is no git ...</summary>
(which is supposed to be there actually with ventura/sonoma and installed xcode dev-tools)

You can follow the next step and install **nix** and then you can create a nix shell with `git` installed temporarely:

```bash
nix run nixpkgs#git

# or via old nix-env command
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.git
```
</details>

And now *cd* into the newly cloned `nix-config` directory:

	$ cd ~/Documents/Code/weiland/nix-config

### Install nix package manager

Via the official nix installer:

```bash
sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)
```

<details>
<summary>Or using Determinate Nix Install / fish shell installation</summary>

Or using [The Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer), which performs well on mac (esp. after mac upgrades) and brings flake support by default:

```command
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

If already in the fish shell:

```fish
sh (curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | psub)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Enable flakes via config file</summary>

Not needed when using my home-manager config (or the Determinate Nix installer).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nix
echo "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

</details>

### Install Homebrew 

It can run independently but is later controlled via _nix-darwin_.


```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

The `brew` command will ba available later after applying the home-manager settings.

### Install mac with nix-darwin

This will apply the nix-darwin config and the home-manager config, so all mac default preferences will be set as well as all apps, tools and binaries will be installed.

```bash
# making sure to be in the right directory
cd ~/Documents/Code/weiland/nix-config
```

The following commands will install the host `Hopper`. Which can be replaced with any other hostname that exists in the `./hosts/` directory.

```bash
sudo nix run --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" nix-darwin -- switch --flake .#Hopper
```

You have to enter your *sudo* password (at least once, perhaps more often as longer it takes) and click on *Allow* when prompted.

<details>
<summary>Or if using flakes remotely:</summary>

TODO(weiland): Fix command below

```bash
sudo nix flake --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' init -t github:weiland/nix-config#darwin
```
</details>

The next step is to **restart** the mac:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Now `nix-command` and `flakes` are enabled by default, so `--extra-experimental-features` can be omitted.


### Update / Rebuild

Run again:

```bash
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#Hopper

# for further times, one can use in any directory:
sudo darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/.config/nix-config#Hopper
```

(Perhaps Full Disk Access is required. Enabled it in the _Privacy & Security_ System Settings for the current Terminal.)

## Finalisation / App Preferences

### iterm

#### re-use config from `data/iterm/`

Set config:

    $ defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 PrefsCustomFolder "/Users/pw/Documents/Code/nix-config/data/iterm"

Alternatively:

1. Open iterm2
2. General -> Preferences -> check *Load preferences from a custom folder or URL*
3. choose `/Users/pw/Documents/Code/weiland/nix-config/data/iterm`
4. And don't overwrite the existing one.

- [ ] Generally, allow *Full Disk Access* for iTerm in System Settings -> Privacy & Security

<details>
<summary>For pre Sonoma:</summary>
If no directory can be selected, iterm has no access to the hard disk.
This can be fixed by open `System Settings` -> Privacy & Security -> Hard Disk Access -> add _iterm2.app_.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Import a new colorscheme</summary>
#### Use a different colorscheme

Set colorscheme:

```fish
open ~/Documents/Code/weiland/nix-config/data/iterm/Oceanic-Next.itermcolors
```

Open any other additional _itermcolors_-file.

Other colorschemes for iterm can be found at: https://iterm2colorschemes.com
and should be downloaded to `data/iterm/`.
